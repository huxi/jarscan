# Jarscan #

A simple and minimal app that scans jar files and prints the maximum major version number of all the contained class files.

Execute `gradlew distZip` to create a zip containing the app at `build/distributions/jarscan.zip`.

This file contains `bin/jarscan` which takes any number of jar files as arguments.
